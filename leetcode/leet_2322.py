# 2322. Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree

# There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.
 
# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

# Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:

# Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
# The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.
# For example, say the three components have the node values: [4,5,7], [1,9], and [3,3,3]. The three XOR values are 4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = 6, 1 ^ 9 = 8, and 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3. The largest XOR value is 8 and the smallest XOR value is 3. The score is then 8 - 3 = 5.
# Return the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.


# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
# - The 1st component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
# - The 2nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
# - The 3rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
# The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
# It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.
